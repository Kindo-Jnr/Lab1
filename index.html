        <h4>Winnie-the-Pooh <span>by A.A. Milne</span></h4>
        <p>
          In the Milne books, Pooh is naive and slow witted, but he is also
          friendly, thoughtful and steadfast. Although he and his friends agree
          that he is "a bear of very little brain," Pooh is occasionally
          acknowledged to have a clever idea, usually driven by common sense.

        <p>
          After a staged attack that killed the President of the United States
          and most most of Congress, a radical political group caleed the "Sons
          of Jacob" used quasi-Christian ideology to launch a revolution. The
          United States Constitution was suspended, newspapers were censored,
          and what was formaly the United States of America was changed into
          military dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead.
